Project of the course “Test Automation Using Selenium and Python” (https://stepik.org/course/575)

Automation of the user interface (testing of interfaces) allows you to conduct regression 
testing and gain more confidence in the quality of the product before its release in production. 
Automated regression tests leave us testers more time to test new product features.
